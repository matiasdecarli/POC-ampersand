## How to run it

1. clone project
2. npm install (be carefull not to delete node_modules. it has 1 module that is not published yet)
3. grunt (this will create the _build folder, and all the production tasks)
4. node server.js

a) in port 3000 is the dev server	-> right click will show temp files
b) in port 3001 is the prod server 	-> right click will show cdn files

TO DO = use the image from the cdn (currently is loaded in the .js file)
